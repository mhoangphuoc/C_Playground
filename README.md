# C/C++ Programing
* Learning C/C++ fundamentals — practice code and small projects. A place to track my progress and share with others.
* This repository contains my C/C++ learning journey. I use it to practice fundamentals, solve exercises, and build small projects.
* My goal is to build a solid programming foundation, keep learning and improving, track my progress over time, and share my work with the community so we can grow together.
